# 🔧 ECE-1245 Final Project

## 💡 Project Title: ThermoLight-Activated LED System

### 📘 Description

This project involves building a **ThermoLight-Activated LED System** using two comparator Op-Amps, a thermistor (temperature sensor), and a photoresistor (light sensor). The system is designed to control LED illumination based on environmental temperature and light intensity.

### 🔑 Key Features

- Circuit design using two comparator Op-Amps
- Integration of a thermistor and photoresistor for environmental sensing
- LED control based on sensor input
- Circuit analysis using:
  - **Node-voltage analysis**
  - Calculation of the inverting input voltage (**V⁻**) for Op-Amps
  - Selection of optimal resistor values for LED operation

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- **LTspice** simulation platform for initial planning and testing
- Basic electronic components including:
  - Thermistor
  - Photoresistor
  - Op-Amps (Comparators)
  - Resistors
  - LEDs
  - Power supply (3.3V)
