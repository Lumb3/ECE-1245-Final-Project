# 🔧 ECE-1245 Final Project

<br/>

## 💡 Project Title: ThermoLight-Activated LED System

<br/>

### 📘 Description

This project involves building a **ThermoLight-Activated LED System** using two comparator Op-Amps, a thermistor (temperature sensor), and a photoresistor (light sensor).  

The system is designed to alert the user by turning on the final LED **only if** it is either too dark or too cold. If both environmental conditions are satisfactory (i.e., bright and warm), the LED remains off, signaling that everything is okay.

<br/>

### 🔑 Key Features

- Integration of a **thermistor** and **photoresistor** for environmental sensing  

- **Three LEDs**:  
  - Two indicate individual sensor states (light and temperature)  
  - One final LED is controlled by a **NAND gate**, indicating whether either condition is unsatisfactory  

- Utilizes a **NAND gate** to turn on the final LED **only when not both** light and temperature are in acceptable ranges  

- Circuit analysis performed using:  
  - **Node-voltage analysis**  
  - Calculation of inverting input voltage (**V⁻**) for Op-Amps  
  - Optimal resistor value selection for reliable LED operation
